# Hi, I’m Fee 💖 the CyberFairy 🧚🏾‍♀️✨

I bring a unique blend of experience in customer service, entrepreneurship, and tech education. As a former technology trainer at a public library, I taught tools like Adobe Illustrator, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro and 3D printing, empowering everyday people to build confidence with technology. Today, I’m channeling that same passion into cybersecurity: analyzing threats, learning tools like KQL and SIEMs, and preparing for certifications like Security+. I thrive at the intersection of creativity, technical knowledge, and human-centered problem solving.

### 🔬 Hands-On Labs

Here are the cybersecurity labs I’ve completed so far. Each one simulates a real-world threat detection, threat intel, or incident response scenario. Every repo includes screenshots, detection queries, or step-by-step analysis to reflect the kind of work done in a SOC environment.

- [🧪 Credential Dump Detection Lab (LSASS Monitoring with Sysmon)](https://github.com/blackgirlinfosec/credential-dump-detection-lab)
  Simulated credential theft by dumping LSASS using Task Manager. Detected the dump file with Sysmon logs and learned how to spot attack behavior using Event IDs 1 and 11.

- 🧠 [Windows Event Log Analysis Lab](https://github.com/blackgirlinfosec/windows-event-log-analysis-lab)  
  Investigated brute-force login attempts using Windows logs and Event Viewer.

- 🛰️ [Suspicious Login Analysis Lab (Azure Sentinel)](https://github.com/blackgirlinfosec/suspicious-login-analysis-lab)  
  Analyzed login failures from foreign IPs using KQL and visualizations in Microsoft Sentinel.

- 🛠️ [Threat Actor Simulation: PowerShell Abuse](https://github.com/blackgirlinfosec/scheduled-task-persistence-lab)  
  Simulated a scheduled task backdoor and documented forensic artifacts using Sysmon.

- 🔍 [Phishing Email Triage Lab](https://github.com/blackgirlinfosec/soc-analyst-lab-phishing-investigation)  
  A beginner-friendly phishing email analysis lab that walks through how to investigate a suspicious message like a real SOC analyst.

- 🧷 [CVE-2025-39507 | Local File Inclusion in WordPress Nasa Core Plugin](https://github.com/blackgirlinfosec/cve-lfi-lab)  
  Researched CVE-2025-39507, A hands on lab from a Tier 1 SOC analyst perspective. Includes log review in Microsoft Sentinel, IP analysis, and a simple breakdown of a local file inclusion vulnerability in a WordPress plugin.

More labs coming soon.
