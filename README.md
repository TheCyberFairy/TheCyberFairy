# Hi, I’m Fee 💖 the CyberFairy 🧚🏾‍♀️✨

I bring a unique blend of experience in customer service, entrepreneurship, and tech education. As a former technology trainer at a public library, I taught tools like Adobe Illustrator, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro and 3D printing, empowering everyday people to build confidence with technology. Today, I’m channeling that same passion into cybersecurity: analyzing threats, learning tools like KQL and SIEMs, and preparing for certifications like Security+. I thrive at the intersection of creativity, technical knowledge, and human-centered problem solving.

### 🔬 Hands-On Labs

Here are the cybersecurity labs I’ve completed so far. Each one simulates a real-world threat detection, threat intel, or incident response scenario. Every repo includes screenshots, detection queries, or step-by-step analysis to reflect the kind of work done in a SOC environment.

- 🧠 [Windows Event Log Analysis Lab](https://github.com/blackgirlinfosec/windows-event-log-analysis-lab)  
  Investigated brute-force login attempts using Windows logs and Event Viewer.

- 🛰️ [Suspicious Login Analysis Lab (Azure Sentinel)](https://github.com/blackgirlinfosec/suspicious-login-analysis-lab)  
  Analyzed login failures from foreign IPs using KQL and visualizations in Microsoft Sentinel.

- 🛠️ [Threat Actor Simulation: PowerShell Abuse](https://github.com/blackgirlinfosec/threat-actor-simulation-lab)  
  Simulated a scheduled task backdoor and documented forensic artifacts using Sysmon.

- 🔍 [Threat Intelligence Research Lab](https://github.com/blackgirlinfosec/threat-intelligence-research-lab)  
  Investigated a real-world CVE using public intel tools like VirusTotal and ANY.RUN.

- 🧷 [CVE Lab: LFI in Simple Inventory System](https://github.com/blackgirlinfosec/cve-lab-lfi-simple-inventory)  
  Researched CVE-2023-33246, demonstrated a local file inclusion attack, and explained its detection path.

More labs coming soon — including phishing analysis, email triage, and Sysmon log parsing on Azure.
