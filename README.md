# Hi, I’m Fee 💖 the CyberFairy 🧚🏾‍♀️✨

I bring a unique blend of experience in customer service, entrepreneurship, and tech education. As a former technology trainer at a public library, I taught tools like Adobe Illustrator, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro and 3D printing, empowering everyday people to build confidence with technology. Today, I’m channeling that same passion into cybersecurity: analyzing threats, learning tools like KQL and SIEMs, and preparing for certifications like Security+. I thrive at the intersection of creativity, technical knowledge, and human-centered problem solving.
